      <h2>Project Overview</h2>
      <p>You can act like a man! Why did you go to the police? Why didn't you come to me first? Michael, you never told me you knew Johnny Fontane! We're both part of the same hypocrisy, senator, but never think it applies to my family. What's the matter with you? Is this what you've become, a Hollywood finocchio who cries like a woman? "Oh, what do I do? What do I do?" What is that nonsense? Ridiculous!</p>
      <p>Why did you go to the police? Why didn't you come to me first? Mr Corleone is Johnny Fontane's godfather. Now Italians regard that as a very close, a very sacred religious relationship. Is that why you slapped my brother around in public? I have a sentimental weakness for my children and I spoil them, as you can see. They talk when they should listen. Your enemies always get strong on what you leave behind.</p>
